.. _csspin_python.uv_provisioner:

============================
csspin_python.uv_provisioner
============================

The ``uv_provisioner`` plugin can be used to change the way the
:ref:`csspin_python.python` creates the virtual environment and installs the
Python packages into it. To do so, the plugin uses `uv`_.

How to setup the ``uv_provisioner`` plugin?
###########################################

For using the ``uv_provisioner`` plugin, a project's ``spinfile.yaml`` must at
least contain the following configuration. Note, that the ``uv`` extra of the
csspin-python plugin-package must be installed for the plugin to work.

    :caption: Minimal configuration of ``spinfile.yaml`` to leverage the ``uv_provisioner``

    plugin_packages:
        - csspin-python[uv]
    plugins:
        - csspin_python:
            - uv_provisioner
    python:
        version: "3.11.9"
    uv_provisioner:
        enabled: true

The provisioning of the required virtual environment as well as the plugins
dependencies can be done via the well-known ``spin provision``-task.

Things to watch out for when using the ``uv_provisioner`` plugin
################################################################

Index URL
---------

When using the ``uv_provisioner`` plugin you must make sure to set
``python.index_url`` so that it points to a simple index.

Windows Defender
----------------

Windows Defender is quite aggressive about ``uv``, which comes to show
especially during ``spin provision`` when the ``uv_provisioner`` is installing
the Python packages.

To speed this up you can exclude the following directories from Windows
Defender. Please note that this comes with additional security risks. Please
also consult `the documentation from Microsoft
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/common-exclusion-mistakes-microsoft-defender-antivirus>`__
in the matter, since excluding temporary directories is considered unsafe:

- ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache``
- ``%TEMP%``
- ``%TMP%``
- ``%TMPDIR%``
